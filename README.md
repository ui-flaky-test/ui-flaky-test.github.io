# An Empirical Analysis of UI-based Flaky Tests

### [Project Page](https://ui-flaky-test.github.io/)


Flaky tests are tests whose outcome changes without altering the test or the code under test. These tests become unreliable,
 and they have been found to impact test-suite in large industrial projects. As a result, these have become an active area of research. 
 Most of this research focuses on traditional unit tests found in non-interactive, non-UI projects. For this reason, we perform a study
 on these UI flaky tests to identify their root causes, how they manifest, and how they are fixed.
